Journalist. An RSS aggregator.


## What is `journalist`?

Journalist is an RSS aggregator that can sync subscriptions and read/unread
items across multiple clients without requiring a special client-side
integration. Clients can use Journalist by simply subscribing to its
personalized RSS feed.

Journalist aims to become a self-hosted alternative to services like Feedly,
Feedbin and others. It aims to offer a similar set of features like FreshRSS,
NewsBlur and Miniflux while being easier to set up/maintain and overall more
lightweight.

If you're looking for pre-v1.0.0 versions of Journalist, please check out the
[v0 branch](https://github.com/mrusme/journalist/tree/v0). *v1.0.0 and later
versions are not compatible to / upgradeable from pre-v1.0.0 versions!*


## Usage

Journalist is a single binary service can be run on any Linux/Unix machine
by setting the required configuration values and launching the `journalist`
program.

Before using Journalist from an RSS client, it first requires
[configuration](#configuration) and [deployment](#deployment).

### Getting Started

As soon as Journalist was [configured](#configuration) and
[deployed](#deployment) properly, a new user can be added using the admin user
that Journalist creates automatically (default login: `admin`:`admin`).

First, make sure to export `JOURNALIST_API_URL` in the current terminal session:

```sh
$ export JOURNALIST_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1"
```

Then, using [Redacteur](#redacteur), a new user can be added like this:

```sh
$ JOURNALIST_API_USERNAME=admin JOURNALIST_API_PASSWORD=admin \
  ./redacteur add user
Username: johndoe
Password: MySecretPassword123
Role (admin/[user]): user
```

Next, a new QAT (*Quick Access Token*) for the user can be issued:

```sh
$ JOURNALIST_API_USERNAME=johndoe JOURNALIST_API_PASSWORD=MySecretPassword123 \
  ./redacteur add token
Token name: FeederAndroidClient
```

Copy the `token` from the JSON response, as this is required to subscribe to the
Journalist feed.

Next, add a new feed to the user (a.k.a. *subscribe to*):

```sh
$ JOURNALIST_API_USERNAME=johndoe JOURNALIST_API_PASSWORD=MySecretPassword123 \
  ./redacteur add feed
URL: https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com
Name: マリウス
Group: Journals
```

Feel free to add further feeds the same way. `Group` describes a *folder*
underneath the feed should be grouped. Groups can be named freely.

With the *Quick Access Token* (`token`) that was copied previously, the
following URL can now be added to any RSS feed reader:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/subscriptions?qat=TOKEN-HERE
```

More information and RSS feed URLs can be found under [Web](#web).


## Configuration

Journalist will read its config either from a file or from environment
variables. Every configuration key available in the
example [`journalist.toml`](examples/etc/journalist.toml) can be exported as
environment variable, by separating scopes using `_` and prepend `JOURNALIST` to
it. For example, the following configuration:

```toml
[Server]
BindIP = "0.0.0.0"
```

... can also be specified as an environment variable:

```sh
export JOURNALIST_SERVER_BINDIP="0.0.0.0"
```

Journalist will try to read the `journalist.toml` file from one of the following
paths:

- `/etc/journalist.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/journalist.toml`
- `$HOME/.config/journalist.toml`
- `$HOME/journalist.toml`
- `$PWD/journalist.toml`


### Database

Journalist requires a database to store users and subscriptions. Supported
database types are SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL. The database can be configured
using the `JOURNALIST_DATABASE_TYPE` and `JOURNALIST_DATABASE_CONNECTION` env,
or the `Database.Type` and `Database.Connection` config properties.

**WARNING:** If you do not specify a database configuration, Journalist will use
an in-memory SQLite database! As soon as Journalist shuts down, all data
inside the in-memory database is gone!


#### SQLite File Example

```toml
[Database]
Type = "sqlite3"
Connection = "file:my-database.sqlite?cache=shared&_fk=1"
```


#### PostgreSQL Example *(using Docker for PostgreSQL)*

Run the database:

```sh
docker run -it --name postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=journalist \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:alpine
```

Configure `Database.Type` and `Database.Connection`:

```toml
[Database]
Type = "postgres"
Connection = "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=journalist user=postgres password=postgres"
```


#### MySQL Example

```toml
[Database]
Type = "mysql"
Connection = "mysqluser:mysqlpassword@tcp(mysqlhost:port)/database?parseTime=true"
```


### Deployment

#### Custom

All that's needed is a [configuration](#configuration) and Journalist can be
launched by e.g. running `./journalist` in a terminal.


#### Supervisor

To run Journalist via `supervisord`, create a config like this inside
`/etc/supervisord.conf` or `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/journalist.conf`:

```ini
[program:journalist]
command=/path/to/binary/of/journalist
process_name=%(program_name)s
numprocs=1
directory=/home/journalist
autostart=true
autorestart=unexpected
startsecs=10
startretries=3
exitcodes=0
stopsignal=TERM
stopwaitsecs=10
user=journalist
redirect_stderr=false
stdout_logfile=/var/log/journalist.out.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=1MB
stdout_logfile_backups=10
stdout_capture_maxbytes=1MB
stdout_events_enabled=false
stderr_logfile=/var/log/journalist.err.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=1MB
stderr_logfile_backups=10
stderr_capture_maxbytes=1MB
stderr_events_enabled=false
```

**Note:** It is advisable to run Journalist under its own, dedicated daemon
user (`journalist` in this example), so make sure to either adjust `directory`
as well as `user` or create a user called `journalist`.


#### OpenBSD rc

As before, create a configuration file under `/etc/journalist.toml`.

Then copy the [example rc.d script](examples/etc/rc.d/journalist) to
`/etc/rc.d/journalist` and copy the binary to e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/journalist`. Last but not least, update the `/etc/rc.conf.local`
file to contain the following line:

```conf
journalist_user="_journalist"
```

It is advisable to run journalist as a dedicated user, hence create the
`_journalist` daemon account or adjust the line above according to your setup.

You can now run Journalist by enabling and starting the service:

```sh
rcctl enable journalist
rcctl start journalist
```

## API

Journalist provides an HTTP REST API for managing user accounts, tokens and
feeds, which is available through the `/api/v1` endpoint. A full OpenAPI/Swagger
documentation of the API can be found inside the [`docs/`](docs/) folder.

### Redacteur

This repository comes with a handy client for the Journalist API called
[*Redacteur*](redacteur). Redacteur can be used to perform actions on the API,
either by manually specifying the exact API request (`redacteur perform ...`) or
by using a shorthand function like `create user`, which runs interactively.

Find out more by running `redacteur help`.


## Web

`/web` is the HTTP web endpoint of Journalist that serves aggregated RSS feeds
as well as *action* endpoints that allow for example marking items as read.

To subscribe to a Journalist user's aggregated RSS feed a *Quick Access Token*
is required. It can be generated using [Redacteur](#redacteur).

With the `QAT`, any RSS feed reader can subscribe to the following URL:

```
<JOURNALIST_SERVER_ENDPOINT_WEB>/subscriptions?qat=<TOKEN>
```

Additionally, subscriptions can be separated by *group*, simply by adding the
`group` parameter to the URL:

```
<JOURNALIST_SERVER_ENDPOINT_WEB>/subscriptions?qat=<TOKEN>&group=Journals
```

With that, only feeds within the *Journal* group will be included in the RSS
feed.

### Mark as Read

Feed items can be marked as read using the inline Journalist menu that is
injected on the top of every RSS item. It contains a link to an *actions
endpoint* of Journalist that will mark either a single item or a specific range
of items as read. This will result in these items not showing up in the
Journalist subscription feed anymore. This way every other client that will
eventually refresh the feed won't *see* these items anymore and hopefully not
display them.

You might need to adjust client settings in order to disable caching of items.
Additionally, if a client has previously synced the items, it might not
automatically remove them from the feed. Whether and how good this works depends
on the client's implementation.


## Development

First, install all required dependencies by running the following command in the
repository folder:

```sh
make install-deps
```

You can then build Journalist by running `make`:

```sh
make
```

This will build a binary called `journalist`.
